Upon installation, you should have access to the :code:`civic-scraper` tool on the command line::

By default, files downloaded by the CLI tool and underlying Python library code
will be saved to the :code:`.civic-scraper` folder in the user's home directory.

On Linux/Mac systems, this will be :code:`~/.civic-scraper/`.


.. _customize cache dir:

Customize cache directory
-------------------------


To use an alternate cache directory, set the below environment variable
